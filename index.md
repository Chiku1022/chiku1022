### My Projects

1. [Stark - The Personal Assistant](https://github.com/Chiku1022/Stark-The-Personal-Assistant).
    This is a personal assistant made by me using Python 3 via PyQt5 framework. It can perform a lot of things. You can give it voice commands as well as written commands. A lot more features are present in it. It uses different technologies like SpeechRecognition, GUI framework, etc.
    While making this project, I learnt how SpeechRecognition engines work, how an application works on a system, how the PyQT framework integrates with python and many other aspects of programming.
    
2. [PyMediaPlayer](https://github.com/Chiku1022/PyMediaPlayer).
    Its a simple media player made in Python using the PyQt5 module. Its a desktop application which can play songs and also display its metadata similar to any other media playback software. It can play audio files with an *mp3* or *wav* extensions. It works on Windows 8 and above.
